            I単igo consistently delivered beyond expectations, actively
            contributing to innovative strategies and the development of SERN.
            Through his willingness to learn, we successfully met several
            deadlines on the expected deliverables of our projects and expanded
            our Network. We can say he was a key element to maintain our
